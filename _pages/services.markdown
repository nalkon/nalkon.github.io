You will walk away with valuable business advice. It may be business strategy, technological advice, or next steps, depending on your needs and where you stand with your business. <br /><br />You are about to embark on a long and risky journey. We can help you minimize and mitigate the risks in just couple of hours. Don’t miss this opportunity."

    title: "Product Guidance"
    excerpt: "Product guidance service is best suited for companies that are about to hire an agency to develop their product. There are a number of things that have to be done before an agency starts product development. We will help you analyze development costs and give you a recommendation on cost savings. Your costs depend on the technological stack your choose, the amount of money you pay to the agency, and the scope of development. Rather than ending up being ripped off by an agency, you can use our expertise to optimize your costs and make sure an agency delivers. We will help you to choose the right agency, shape your product (build product architecture and roadmap), and prepare it to be handed over to an agency.  We will mentor you on how to stay on top of things with an agency.  We can also monitor project execution as your trusted representative (offered as separate service). "

    title: "CTO as a Service"
    excerpt: "This service is for companies that are about to start development of their product in-house, or already started the development and need some help improving the development process, or moving their product development from agency to in-house development.  Instead of hiring a full time CTO (which will cost your business about $200K yearly) you can use our expertise for a fraction of the cost. “CTO as a Service” is a flexible arrangement (hire us for as many hours per week as you need) that offers you help in the following areas: analyzing your product and defining the best strategy moving forward; defining hiring strategy, and building or growing your development team; building and optimizing processes that will allow you to move forward more efficiently; establishing the best development practices."
